HOW MODULES WORK:

- in modules folder, each module has its own directory
- within there there must be an index.js file, this is picked up by 
the inport of the module in main.js
- when index.js runs, it imports the router from within the module's files
and returns it
- the router is the one which initialises the actual module content
